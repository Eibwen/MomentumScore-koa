# MomentumScore-koa (the koa part)

This is my first try at a koa application, and first time using generators.  So mainly this was to play with new templating and serving techonlogies, more than actually achieving anything.

That said, its really easy to work with, and just due to that I'll probably try to tweak this some more in the next week (then hackathon presentation occurs and I'll likely stop caring :) )
